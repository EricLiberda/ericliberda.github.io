      <h2>About</h2>
 <p>
  Dr.&nbsp;Eric&nbsp;N.&nbsp;Liberda is a director and professor in the School of Occupational and Public Health at Toronto Metropolitan University. He completed both his undergraduate and first master’s degrees in Environmental Health from the University of Waterloo, a second master’s degree in Toxicology at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Australia, and a doctorate in Environmental Medicine (Environmental Health Sciences, Exposure Assessment and Toxicology) at the New York University School of Medicine.
  As an active member of the Society of Toxicology, the Society of Toxicology Canada, and the Society of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, his research programs are driven by a commitment to protecting human health with evidence-based methods. This work has produced influential publications and highly competitive research grants that examine the impacts of pesticides, toxic metals, and nanoparticles on human health.
  Dr.&nbsp;Liberda’s research also considers broad and holistic determinants of health and well-being, integrating physiological and psychosocial measures of stress, resilience, and wellness into environmental health science—especially through long-standing collaborations with Indigenous communities in Canada. Guided by community-based participatory research principles, this work attends to biomedical indicators (e.g., metabolomics, biomarkers, and exposure assessment) alongside culturally grounded conceptions of health and well-being, linking environmental exposures to broader determinants to support healthier, more resilient communities.
  Across all projects, he advances transdisciplinary approaches and teams spanning toxicology, epidemiology, Indigenous studies, engineering, public health policy, and the social sciences. His programs employ emerging technologies and fields (including metabolomics, 3D printing, virtual and augmented reality, and machine learning) while embedding Indigenous knowledge systems, worldviews, and governance structures within both research and team practices. This integrative, collaborative model not only generates novel methods and insights but also enables meaningful knowledge translation that supports equity, sustainability, and the self-determination of partner communities.
